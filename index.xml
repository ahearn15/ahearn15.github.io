&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Isolating the Mechanisms Behind the Test-Optional Admissions Policy</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test-optional admissions policy is a growing tactic among four-year postsecondary institutions in the United States. While each institution decides individually whether or not to implement this policy, there has been little research done in evaluating these collective decisions across colleges and universities. By using machine learning algorithms across a range of institutions, I am able to uncover trends across schools that shine a light on why institutions may be heading in this direction. I find that the motives for implementing this policy may be different depending on the selectivity of the school.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Memorandum to Betsy Devos</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;memorandum&#34;&gt;MEMORANDUM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To:&lt;/strong&gt; Betsy Devos, US Secretary of Education&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Adam Hearn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; February 22, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; Recommendation for Stricter Quality Control of For-Profit Institutions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;recommendation&#34;&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend that the Department of Education apply stricter quality control standards on for-profit colleges and universities. Students who attend these institutions are assured compelling employment post-graduation upon enrollment, but rarely are these promises realized. This leaky pipeline of at-risk students from the moment they step on campus (or boot up their computer, in the age of technology-driven education) to their nearly inevitable drop-out is explicitly due to the lack of governance from the Department of Education in this sector. With stricter accreditation standards and government regulation of these businesses, we can increase student attainment and postsecondary success, especially among those in traditionally underrepresented groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who attend for-profit institutions are not your typical, wide-eyed first-year college students. Instead, these students are disproportionately older, African-American, single parents.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn1&#34;&gt;1]&lt;/a&gt; Frankly, your administration exploits these students to the point where they are more likely to drop out and default on their loans, leaving many of these students in a position where they would have been better off not going to college at all.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn2&#34;&gt;2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are attracted to these for-profit institutions due to easy enrollment and help to find financial aid. However, many of these students are disappointed with the poor quality of education they receive.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn3&#34;&gt;3]&lt;/a&gt; Post-graduation, this subsequently leads to troubles finding employment and unsustainable levels of debt. For-profit institutions account for roughly 22% of all postsecondary borrowers, yet these students comprise approximately 33% of all loan defaults.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn4&#34;&gt;4]&lt;/a&gt; These numbers suggest that the for-profit sector primarily drives the ongoing student-loan crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policies (or lack thereof) set forth by the Department of Education concerning for-profit education exacerbate many of the issues in this sector of postsecondary education, disproportionately affecting minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-proposals-for-stricter-quality-control-of-for-profit-institutions&#34;&gt;Key Proposals for Stricter Quality Control of For-Profit Institutions:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apply     stricter standards for accreditation agencies.&lt;/em&gt; The accreditation standards put forth by the     Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) and other     national accrediting agencies are far too lenient. Currently, ACICS claims     that for-profit institutions are required to report a retention rate of at     least 75%.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn5&#34;&gt;5]&lt;/a&gt; Changing these accreditation standards to include     student outcomes (e.g., graduation rates and average debt accumulation)     would increase postsecondary student success. I understand this     administration has restored the accreditation powers of ACICS after losing     authority under the Obama administration. Still, I recommend that the     Department of Education work alongside this agency and other national     accreditors to amend their current accreditation policies to reflect     student outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mandate for-profit institutions to publish attainment and default rates.&lt;/em&gt; By requiring for-profit colleges to publish attainment     outcomes and default rates, students would be more aware of the type of     education in this sector. In doing so, for-profit institutions would     either be (a) pushed to improve their practices further, or (b) forced out     of business. This policy would increase student outcomes while maintaining     for-profit competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improve     information sharing on postsecondary options to prospective students.&lt;/em&gt; Students who attend for-profit institutions are more     likely to default on their loans than students who attend non-profit or     public colleges and universities.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn6&#34;&gt;6]&lt;/a&gt;     This behavior is likely due to a     lack of information regarding federal loans given to prospective students     before enrollment. By providing more information on postsecondary access     to prospective students through brochures at public schools, prisons, and     VA groups, students will be more aware of their postsecondary options and     financial aid obligations before enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions-and-politics&#34;&gt;Conclusions and Politics:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure these recommendations land with your administration, I want to stress the importance of aligning higher education with the needs of the economy. Because of their high tuitions and needy students, for-profit institutions consume a large amount of federal aid with minimal returns to the students or the nation’s workforce.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn7&#34;&gt;7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student outcomes following enrollment at for-profit institutions are far inferior to those of non-profit or public colleges or universities, primarily due to the lack of regulation of this industry. To guarantee that the future workforce meets the needs of the economy, the quality of education received at the for-profit sector of postsecondary education needs to be on-par with its non-profit and public counterparts. These outcomes can be achieved by stricter accreditation standards while maintaining similar standards for enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The for-profit education industry exploits students of all backgrounds, including high-school drop-outs, single parents, and veterans. Your policies and actions regarding for-profit education have failed to recognize these groups and their career goals. As Secretary of Education, you should ensure that these underrepresented groups have little barriers to pursuing a quality postsecondary education with worthwhile outcomes and minimal debt. With these outcomes in mind, I hope that these recommendations and policies can gain traction under this administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;memorandum&#34;&gt;MEMORANDUM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To:&lt;/strong&gt; Betsy Devos, US Secretary of Education&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From:&lt;/strong&gt; Adam Hearn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; February 22, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; Recommendation for Stricter Quality Control of For-Profit Institutions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;recommendation&#34;&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend that the Department of Education apply stricter quality control standards on for-profit colleges and universities. Students who attend these institutions are assured compelling employment post-graduation upon enrollment, but rarely are these promises realized. This leaky pipeline of at-risk students from the moment they step on campus (or boot up their computer, in the age of technology-driven education) to their nearly inevitable drop-out is explicitly due to the lack of governance from the Department of Education in this sector. With stricter accreditation standards and government regulation of these businesses, we can increase student attainment and postsecondary success, especially among those in traditionally underrepresented groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who attend for-profit institutions are not your typical, wide-eyed first-year college students. Instead, these students are disproportionately older, African-American, single parents.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn1&#34;&gt;1]&lt;/a&gt; Frankly, your administration exploits these students to the point where they are more likely to drop out and default on their loans, leaving many of these students in a position where they would have been better off not going to college at all.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn2&#34;&gt;2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students are attracted to these for-profit institutions due to easy enrollment and help to find financial aid. However, many of these students are disappointed with the poor quality of education they receive.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn3&#34;&gt;3]&lt;/a&gt; Post-graduation, this subsequently leads to troubles finding employment and unsustainable levels of debt. For-profit institutions account for roughly 22% of all postsecondary borrowers, yet these students comprise approximately 33% of all loan defaults.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn4&#34;&gt;4]&lt;/a&gt; These numbers suggest that the for-profit sector primarily drives the ongoing student-loan crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policies (or lack thereof) set forth by the Department of Education concerning for-profit education exacerbate many of the issues in this sector of postsecondary education, disproportionately affecting minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-proposals-for-stricter-quality-control-of-for-profit-institutions&#34;&gt;Key Proposals for Stricter Quality Control of For-Profit Institutions:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apply     stricter standards for accreditation agencies.&lt;/em&gt; The accreditation standards put forth by the     Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) and other     national accrediting agencies are far too lenient. Currently, ACICS claims     that for-profit institutions are required to report a retention rate of at     least 75%.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn5&#34;&gt;5]&lt;/a&gt; Changing these accreditation standards to include     student outcomes (e.g., graduation rates and average debt accumulation)     would increase postsecondary student success. I understand this     administration has restored the accreditation powers of ACICS after losing     authority under the Obama administration. Still, I recommend that the     Department of Education work alongside this agency and other national     accreditors to amend their current accreditation policies to reflect     student outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mandate for-profit institutions to publish attainment and default rates.&lt;/em&gt; By requiring for-profit colleges to publish attainment     outcomes and default rates, students would be more aware of the type of     education in this sector. In doing so, for-profit institutions would     either be (a) pushed to improve their practices further, or (b) forced out     of business. This policy would increase student outcomes while maintaining     for-profit competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improve     information sharing on postsecondary options to prospective students.&lt;/em&gt; Students who attend for-profit institutions are more     likely to default on their loans than students who attend non-profit or     public colleges and universities.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn6&#34;&gt;6]&lt;/a&gt;     This behavior is likely due to a     lack of information regarding federal loans given to prospective students     before enrollment. By providing more information on postsecondary access     to prospective students through brochures at public schools, prisons, and     VA groups, students will be more aware of their postsecondary options and     financial aid obligations before enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions-and-politics&#34;&gt;Conclusions and Politics:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure these recommendations land with your administration, I want to stress the importance of aligning higher education with the needs of the economy. Because of their high tuitions and needy students, for-profit institutions consume a large amount of federal aid with minimal returns to the students or the nation’s workforce.[&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn7&#34;&gt;7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student outcomes following enrollment at for-profit institutions are far inferior to those of non-profit or public colleges or universities, primarily due to the lack of regulation of this industry. To guarantee that the future workforce meets the needs of the economy, the quality of education received at the for-profit sector of postsecondary education needs to be on-par with its non-profit and public counterparts. These outcomes can be achieved by stricter accreditation standards while maintaining similar standards for enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The for-profit education industry exploits students of all backgrounds, including high-school drop-outs, single parents, and veterans. Your policies and actions regarding for-profit education have failed to recognize these groups and their career goals. As Secretary of Education, you should ensure that these underrepresented groups have little barriers to pursuing a quality postsecondary education with worthwhile outcomes and minimal debt. With these outcomes in mind, I hope that these recommendations and policies can gain traction under this administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning each year around August, prospective college-goers begin filling out their applications to send off to institutions where they may end up for the next four years. The elements that go into this decision include the academic quality of the institution, the campus climate, and for some, the athletic successes the school has achieved in previous years. My research focuses on the last of these elements, as I assessed how collegiate athletics at the highest level impact postsecondary institutional metrics. In doing so, I found significant evidence that football success leads to increased applications, first-year enrollment, and reported SAT scores.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using NCAA Track Data as a Predictor for Race Times</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the invention of the internet and television, collegiate athletic results were more of a guessing game. Coaches would be in contact with one another via letter mail, a rather antiquated system by today’s standards. According to the Rhodes College Track &amp;amp; Field Head Coach, Robert Shankman, coaches would create “pacts” with one another promising to send their results to each other after every competition. However, with this came various reporting errors such as “sandbagging” in results (i.e. reporting one&amp;rsquo;s time as faster or slower than it actually is), or failure to send results altogether. Furthermore, school records and qualifications for NCAA Championships were dependent upon these marks, yet coaches and athletes may not have submitted these marks with honesty and integrity: a key violation of the NCAA Code of Ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not until 2010 that the invention of the Track &amp;amp; Field Results Reporting System, more colloquially known as TFRRS, came along. TFRRS (pronounced TEE-furs) is a website mandated by the NCAA to be the hub of all collegiate track &amp;amp; field results and rankings. Each collegiate meet director must submit their results to this website at the conclusion of their event. As a result, this website is a robust database of all things track &amp;amp; field, including every athlete, event, and meet held since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-collection-methods&#34;&gt;Data Collection Methods&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-authors and teammates, Adam Hearn and Will Raines, track &amp;amp; field athletes for Rhodes College, are active users of this website. Whether they are checking their most recent times and rankings or stalking their competition for their next meet, they find themselves on this website multiple times a day. When looking at the centralized nature of the data, Adam realized he could easily mine this data into a format to be read by statistical packages. Once mined, the dataset culminated into one with over 225,000 observations, including every NCAA Division I, II, and III athlete, male and female, who has ever participated in a track event since 2012. The events that we have included in our dataset are the 100 meter dash, 200 meter dash, 400 meter dash, 800 meter run, 1500 meter run, 3000 meter Steeplechase, 5000 meter run, and 10000 meter run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To collect this data, the statistical package Stata was used to convert and clean over 400 .hmtl tables to .csv format, by stripping html tags, merging athletes, and converting time from a string value in HH:MM:SS.mm format to a float value of time in seconds. These methods were chosen specifically to optimize both numeric and qualitative analyses of these results. For each year, after each event was converted into its own comma delimited file, that file would be merged with every other event so that each athlete&amp;rsquo;s times for that season are in its own observation. The pseudocode is presented in Algorithm 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;seasons = range(2012, 2019)
events = (100, 200, 400, 800, 1500, 3000, 5000, 10000)
genders = (male, female)
divisions = (1, 2, 3)

i = 0
x = 0
foreach season in seasons:
  foreach event in events:
    foreach gender in genders:
      foreach division in division:
        goto website, copy as txt
        save as season_event_gender_division.txt
        strip .html tags
        convert eventTime (str) to float
        save as event[i].dta
        i++
Merge athlete to athlete
while x &amp;lt; i:
  append event[x].dta
  x++
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this nested loop was run, each season was appended below the
previous to culminate into a master dataset of over 225,000
observations. A sample observation includes: the individual&amp;rsquo;s name,
their school, their gender, their NCAA division, and their season-best
times and percentile for each event they ran. There are several missing
values, as it is unlikely that an individual ran the 100m, 200m, 400m,
800m, 1500m, 3000m Steeplechase, 5000m, and 10000m meter races all in
the same year (in fact, there are only three individuals in this entire
dataset that have done so). Track &amp;amp; field runners often specialize in
one, two, or three events, so the typical athlete will have several
missing values in their observation. Additionally, the athletes in this
dataset are tracked longitudinally. If an athlete competes all four
years of their eligibility, they will have four observations present in
this dataset&amp;ndash;one for each year of competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;inside-the-data&#34;&gt;Inside the Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we take a look at the algorithms and techniques we used to
analyze the data, we decided it would help to the non-track &amp;amp; field
trained eye to take a look at summary statistics for each event, by
breaking up the data between NCAA division and gender: the two nominal
attributes we hope to uncover trends within. Statistics on average
times, standard deviation, and participation by division and gender are
displayed in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;800m&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1500m&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3000m Steeple&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-in-times-and-variance-by-division&#34;&gt;Differences in Times and Variance by Division&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to available scholarship money at prominent, nationally-recognized
Division I schools, programs like the University of Georgia, the
University of Oregon, and Northern Arizona University attract the top
high school athletes from around the country. Division II programs,
including Adams State University and Grand Valley State, also attract
talented athletes, but their times are typically slower than that of a
Division I prospect. Division III, the division with the widest variance
across events, does not offer athletic scholarships but instead offers
the opportunity to study at top-academically ranked institutions such as
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, and
Williams College while still competing at the NCAA level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data support the claim that time increases as NCAA division
increases; that is, Division I as the fastest and Division III as the
slowest. For the most part, the standard deviation of each event
increases alongside division as well. As expected, Division I has the
fastest times and lowest variance across all events. Prospective
student-athletes hoping to compete at the NCAA level should use Table 1
to determine what might be a best-fit NCAA division given their current
athletic ability. While they must take into account time for improvement
between high school and college, the table presented should be adequate
as a rough estimate of the competition to expect at each division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that standard deviation is also much higher, on
average, for females as opposed to males across events. This phenomenon
is discussed and represented graphically in Section 2.1. This is likely
correlated with Title IX imperatives and programs accepting women with
lower athletic standards relative to their male teammates in order to
meet roster requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;participation&#34;&gt;Participation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the differences in participation between male and female
athletes in Table 1. While both have relatively similar numbers across
all divisions, there are several more females who compete at the
Division I level than males. Likewise, there are many more male track
athletes in Division III than females. Division II numbers are
relatively constant across both genders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Title IX imperatives have mandated schools provide equal athletic
roster spots for men and women, men&amp;rsquo;s track &amp;amp; field is often one of the
sports &amp;ldquo;cut\&amp;rdquo; to make room for women&amp;rsquo;s scholarships at the Division I
level. For example, several nationally recognized institutions such as
Vanderbilt University, Southern Methodist University, University of
Maryland, and Temple University do not offer men&amp;rsquo;s track &amp;amp; field, but do
offer women&amp;rsquo;s. Additionally, women&amp;rsquo;s programs often times increase their
roster sizes larger than their male counterparts to meet Title IX
standards and make up for the discrepancies in participation numbers
caused by the large cohort of football athletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the lower number of roster spots available for males in
Division I, many prospective male college athletes flock to Division III
to continue their passion for the sport. Furthermore, male enrollment in
D-III private schools has been declining in recent years, so
institutions are expanding opportunities in track &amp;amp; field to enroll more
males. These phenomenons occurring in collegiate athletics can help
explain the discrepancies in participation numbers across divisions and
genders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-in-time-distribution-between-genders&#34;&gt;Differences in Time Distribution between Genders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When loading our data into Weka, the first visualization that pops up is
a distribution table by each event. When first looking at these
distributions, it became apparent that there were two distinct bell
curves: one of which we assumed would be for men, and the other for
women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested this hypothesis by making histograms of the figures by gender.
When looking at the results, our hypothesis was correct. We also noticed
that male times are much more &amp;ldquo;centralized\&amp;rdquo; than female times, as the
males&amp;ndash;depicted in dark blue&amp;ndash;have a skinnier, yet taller bell curve.
Female times&amp;ndash;depicted in green&amp;ndash;have more variance and are more widely
distributed. Males and females together are shown in light blue,
displaying the initial trends we first discovered such as the distinct
bell curves.&lt;/p&gt;

width=&amp;rdquo;\linewidth&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that some events have more normally distributed times than
others. For example, the 100m, 3000m Steeplechase, and 10000m races have
roughly one local maximum (across both genders, as depicted in light
blue) as opposed to the other events which have two. This could
correspond to these events being the most &amp;ldquo;extreme\&amp;rdquo; of the track events
offered as the 100m dash is the shortest event contested and the 10000m
race is the longest. Furthermore, hurdle heights differ slightly between
males and females in the 3000 Steeplechase which closes the gap between
the two genders in competition time. For this reason, the 3000m
Steeplechase is not a prominent event featured in our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-simple-ols-as-a-predictor&#34;&gt;Using Simple OLS as a Predictor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the highly correlated nature of track &amp;amp; field results, one could
use this data to make predictions of what time to expect in an event
based off results from another event. Let&amp;rsquo;s take, for example, the 100
and 200 meter dash. Typically, the faster an athlete can cover 100
meters on foot, the faster they can cover 200 meters as well. When
looking at this relationship graphically in Figure 2.a, the correlation
is apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;100200.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;100m and 200m.&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;rdquo;\linewidth&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;8001500.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;800m and 1500m.&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;rdquo;\linewidth&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;5k10k.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;5000m and 10000m.&#34; /&gt;{width=&amp;rdquo;\linewidth&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same relationship can be inferred between &amp;ldquo;similar\&amp;rdquo; events. For the
sake of simplicity, we will define three &amp;ldquo;similar\&amp;rdquo; event groups from
this dataset. We will define the &amp;ldquo;sprints\&amp;rdquo; group as athletes who have
100m and 200m times; the &amp;ldquo;middle distance\&amp;rdquo; group as 800m and 1500m
athletes; and the &amp;ldquo;distance\&amp;rdquo; group as 5000m and 10000m runners. In this
section, we will be looking primarily at the relationships between these
similar events, represented graphically in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple OLS regression model was written to predict times within
&amp;ldquo;similar\&amp;rdquo; event groups. A sample equation to predict 200m times from
100m times is shown below: $$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{time200}&lt;em&gt;{i} = \beta&lt;/em&gt;{0} &amp;amp; + \beta&lt;em&gt;{1}  \mathrm{time100}&lt;/em&gt;{i} + \upsilon\end{aligned}$$
When repeating this for middle-distance and distance groups, a
regression output was produced with the coefficients all highly
statistically significant at P $&amp;lt;$ 0.001. With the slope coefficients
and constants provided by the regression, when providing a sample time,
a predicted time can be estimated (shown in Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100m    $\widehat{200m}$      800m   $\widehat{1500m}$      5000m   $\widehat{10000m}$

   12.00        24.60            2:10        4:28.86           16:00         33:40
   12.50        25.68            2:15        4:38.28           16:15         34:11
   13.00        26.77            2:20        4:47.70           16:30         34:43

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when predicting across similar events, it is best to use the
simple OLS model to estimate the true value. However, this same
significance of correlation should not be taken for granted across
&amp;ldquo;dissimilar\&amp;rdquo; events. For example, take a look at Table 2 which shows a
correlation matrix of each event&amp;rsquo;s correlation with one another. Notice
the declining nature of the correlation as the events become less
similar between one another, especially in the 100m. As each event
distance increases, the correlation coefficient decreases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When regressing each event on 5000m time using simple OLS, the R-squared
value increases significantly as the event distance increases and
becomes more aligned with the 5K. 800m time explains 77.9% of variation
in 5K time, whereas 10K time accounts for nearly 94%. We will discuss
applications to use multiple-linear regression techniques in Section 3.2
which can apply to predictions across dissimilar events; for example,
predicting 400m time based off of 100m time and 200m time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;multiple-linear-regression-applications-and-biasedness&#34;&gt;Multiple-Linear Regression Applications and Biasedness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As robust as this dataset is, it would be a crime to solely use ordinary
least squares regression techniques. In fact, using a multiple-linear
regression model would be ideal for data in this nature. To get the best
linear unbiased estimate, a user of this data should apply as many
variables as possible to get the ideal result. It is our hope to publish
this data to a website in the near future so a user can specify as many
or as little variables as possible to decrease bias and get the desired
prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, an NCAA Division I All-American male. This young man
has excelled in the 800m this season, and has also run some decent 1500m
times. However, his coach is debating entering him in the 5000m at their
conference meet in an attempt to score points for their team. The
athlete has never run a 5000m race before, but his coach, who happens to
be an econometrician, hypothesizes he can lock up at least a top-5
finish. The coach plugs his 800m time into the equation to test this
hypothesis and predict his 5K time. However, the economist coach is
shocked at how fast this time is, and knows this is due to the
dissimilarity between middle-distance and distance as well as the
dreaded omitted-variable bias and zero-conditional mean violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bias in the predicted 5000m is an underestimate due to this omitted
variable. In other words, the true value of the predicted 5K time is
slower than the one outputted by the regression. Once controlling for
1500m time as well, the estimator becomes less biased and the predicted
5000m comes out more accurate. This increases the R-sqaured value of the
regression and pushes the estimated value closer to its true value. If
the coach did not take into account this omitted variable bias, his
athlete would have been unlikely to score in the 5000m, and would have
performed worse off in the 800m as well due to fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more parameters entered in the analysis, the more accurate an
estimation will become. For example, the Division I All-American male
mentioned above may have a different trend-line across events than a
Division III, back-of-the-pack female runner. The relationship produced
by the regression is linear in nature; however, that relationship
changes slightly as variables are added or change. Controlling for those
factors (i.e. NCAA division, gender, and class year) in the regression
will produce a more accurate, less-biased outcome. A sample equation a
user could enter is below: $$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{time5000}&lt;em&gt;{i} = \beta&lt;/em&gt;{0} &amp;amp; + \beta&lt;em&gt;{1}  \mathrm{time800}&lt;/em&gt;{i} + \beta&lt;em&gt;{2}  \mathrm{time1500}&lt;/em&gt;{i} + \beta&lt;em&gt;{3}  \mathrm{time10000}&lt;/em&gt;{i} + \beta&lt;em&gt;{4}  \mathrm{male}&lt;/em&gt;{i} + \beta&lt;em&gt;{5}  \mathrm{NCAAdiv}&lt;/em&gt;{i} + \upsilon \end{aligned}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This equation would provide a much more accurate prediction of 5000m
time for the athlete than the original simple OLS model earlier
referenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shoulders-of-giants-the-riegel-model&#34;&gt;Shoulders of Giants: The Riegel Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first person to develop an analysis on the prediction of race times
for runners and other athletes was the American research engineer, Peter
Riegel. While Riegel primarily focused his research on bioengineering,
deep sea diving equipment, and air flow in coal mines, he also provided
measurement techniques for USA Track &amp;amp; Field (USATF). Riegel
additionally designed and measured marathon courses for multiple
Olympics and Olympic Trials. In addition to his measurement research,
Riegel proposed a formula to predict race times for one distance based
off another: $$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Time}&lt;em&gt;{2} = \mathrm{Time}&lt;/em&gt;{1} \times (\mathrm{Distance}&lt;em&gt;{1} \div \mathrm{Distance}&lt;/em&gt;{2})^{1.06}\end{aligned}$$
This rather elementary equation, first published in a 1977 article of
&lt;em&gt;Runner&amp;rsquo;s World&lt;/em&gt;, has been used by many to predict race times based off
another. It has been criticized by many due to predicting seemingly
unobtainable times.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As simple as this equation is, it does not account for the
aforementioned omitted variable bias and zero conditional mean violation
that come along with only including one &amp;ldquo;event\&amp;rdquo; variable. To provide
the best linear unbiased estimator of race times, more than just one
event should be entered in the equation. Therefore, it is our belief
that the multiple-linear regression model provided with our data should
provide the more accurate analysis on the prediction of times,
especially for collegiate athletes. We believe that the multiple-linear
regression model provided with our data should provide the more accurate
analysis on the prediction of times. We hope to analyze this claim in
the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;classification-analysis&#34;&gt;Classification Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times in track meets, schools from all NCAA divisions compete
against one another head-to-head. As distance runners for Rhodes, we
have often toed the line against top NCAA D-I programs such as Duke,
Michigan State, Kentucky, and Colorado. In these races, it gives
ourselves a chance to see how we stack up against runners from more
historically successful programs. We often find ourselves,
nationally-competitive NCAA Division III runners, beating some of these
athletes, even though they are given the clout of athletic scholarships
and many more resources thrown into their track program that come along
with attending a Division I institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This begs the question, does NCAA division make as big of a difference
in performance as it is made out to be? Additionally, due to the
homogenous nature of track &amp;amp; field events, one could assert that the top
NCAA Division I female runner would most likely be the best athlete on a
mid-tier Division III men&amp;rsquo;s team. Is there a robust difference across
genders as well? To examine this question, we will be using
classification algorithms to assert if these dichotomies across NCAA
divisions and genders are as prominent as they are traditionally
believed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;classification-between-gender&#34;&gt;Classification between Gender&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times in track meets, heats of the 10000m will be combined with
men and women in the same race. While the results are still separated by
gender, the desegregation of sexes in this event is done to save time
(after all, two heats of 10000 meter races could take up to 90 minutes
to complete). While men are typically faster across the various
distances in track &amp;amp; field, this gives a chance for the top women
athletes to chase after and beat the bottom-of-the-pack males in the
same race. To examine this phenomenon, we will be using a Naı̈ve Bayes
classification algorithm to classify NCAA athletes by gender. The
algorithm correctly classifies 199,231 of the 225,335 athletes, and
produces an accuracy rate of 88.4%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sole attribute that shows the differentiation between males and
females in this dataset is time, as males are traditionally faster than
females on average. Due to the fact that this classification model was
built solely on time variables, some of the slower males (10,891
athletes) were assigned as female while the faster females (15,233
athletes) were classified as male. The result, displayed in the
confusion matrix in Table 3, suggests that nearly 12% of all NCAA track
&amp;amp; field athletes would be a good fit athletically on a team of the
opposite gender, regardless of division. This result, while still
significant at 88.4%, suggests that there is still a divide between
genders athletically at the NCAA level. However, the fastest females are
still competitive with the slowest males.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;classifying-ncaa-divisions&#34;&gt;Classifying NCAA Divisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society portrays NCAA Division I being head and shoulders above Division
II and Division III. After all, Division I is where the athletes are
given top resources and scholarships with the promise of a professional
career. Division II offers some scholarships, but professional careers
are less common. Lastly, there&amp;rsquo;s Division III, where athletes are given
the opportunity to pursue their sport without athletic scholarships.
When looking solely at the athletic data within track &amp;amp; field times, the
divide between NCAA divisions is not as dichotomous as many athletes and
fans portray it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Naı̈ve Bayes classification algorithm was originally run to classify
athletes, both male and female, into NCAA divisions based off of their
performances in various events. The results in our original model were
fascinating, as the algorithm only correctly classified 49.52% of all
NCAA track &amp;amp; field athletes into the correct division. However, with
these results, only two observations were placed into Division II. With
that discrepancy, we decided to break it down even further by
classifying athletes into NCAA division by gender. The algorithm
performed marginally better with the results in the confusion matrices
in Table 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0.5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;         D-I    34,552   188   9,960
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actual   D-II    13,082   94    10,862
            D-III   16,170   140   28,425&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;: NCAA Division Classification Confusion Matrix by Gender&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0.5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;         D-I    41,755   168   7,640
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actual   D-II    13,469   197   10,198
            D-III   14,041   312   24,102&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;: NCAA Division Classification Confusion Matrix by Gender&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm performed slightly better for females than males,
suggesting that the divide between NCAA divisions are greater for women
and that times differ more across division. The algorithm correctly
classified 59.03% of women as opposed to only 55.58% of men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the adjustments made to break up the NCAA division
classification by gender, the algorithm still performed poorly when
classifying Division II athletes. While Division I athletes typically
lead all divisions in time, and Division III runners are typically
slower and bring up the rear, Division II athletes find themselves
toward the middle. This dilemma makes it harder to classify Division II
athletes especially considering the division&amp;rsquo;s large variation in times.
This phenomenon is displayed in Figure 4, which shows all-division
percentile on the y-axis and the athlete&amp;rsquo;s time on the x-axis for males
(left) and females (right). The data points are broken up by NCAA
division with navy blue representing D-I, cranberry D-II, and mint green
D-III. The graph was created for the 5000m run, but the trends are
similar across all events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;5000perc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Male and Female 5000m time by All-Division
Percentile[]{label=&amp;quot;fig:relationship&amp;quot;}&#34; /&gt;{#fig:relationship
width=&amp;ldquo;15cm&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;association-mining-what-determines-your-events&#34;&gt;Association Mining: What determines your events?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that each athlete (or observation) either has a time in an event
or no time in that event, we decided to manipulate the data to mine
association rules on what determines the event athletes run. To do this,
we modified the numerical value for each &amp;ldquo;time\&amp;rdquo; variable to a binary
value of 1 if the athlete had a value for that time, or 0 if they did
not. Therefore, think of the new variables representing &amp;ldquo;ran100\&amp;rdquo; rather
than &amp;ldquo;time100\&amp;ldquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apriori algorithm we performed produced a large information gain on
these association rules. However, due to our athletic intuition and
prior knowledge, these results did not reveal much. For example, it is
common knowledge that a 100m sprinter is unlikely to run the 10000m at
any point during their athletic career. Because we knew the algorithm
including all events involved extraneousness, we decided to cut down the
analysis to the aforementioned &amp;ldquo;similar events.\&amp;rdquo; However, this time,
the similar events will be generalized as the sprints (100m, 200m, and
400m) and distance (800m, 1500m, 5000m 10000m).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new dataset was created with just athletes who have run the 100m,
200m, and/or 400m races to create the following association rules. For
the sprints group, the best associations we found were the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ran100&lt;/em&gt; = 0 $\wedge$ &lt;em&gt;ran200&lt;/em&gt; = 0 $\rightarrow$ &lt;em&gt;ran400&lt;/em&gt; = 1
(Confidence = 1, Lift = 1.94)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ran100&lt;/em&gt; = 0 $\wedge$ &lt;em&gt;ran400&lt;/em&gt; = 0 $\rightarrow$ &lt;em&gt;ran200&lt;/em&gt; = 1
(Confidence = 1, Lift = 1.52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ran200&lt;/em&gt; = 0 $\wedge$ &lt;em&gt;ran400&lt;/em&gt; = 0 $\rightarrow$ &lt;em&gt;ran100&lt;/em&gt; = 1
(Confidence = 1, Lift = 1.93)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ran200&lt;/em&gt; = 0 $\wedge$ &lt;em&gt;ran400&lt;/em&gt; = 0 $\rightarrow$ &lt;em&gt;ran100&lt;/em&gt; = 1
(Confidence = 0.82, Lift = 1.72)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same pruning was repeated for the distance runners, as we created a
dataset with only those who have run a 800m, 1500m, 5000m or 10000m race
to provide the following association rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ran800&lt;/em&gt; = 1 $\wedge$ &lt;em&gt;ran5000&lt;/em&gt; = 0 $\rightarrow$ &lt;em&gt;ran10000&lt;/em&gt; = 0
(Confidence = 1, Lift = 1.19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ran5000&lt;/em&gt; = 0 $\rightarrow$ &lt;em&gt;ran10000&lt;/em&gt; = 0 (Confidence = 0.98, Lift =
1.17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ran800&lt;/em&gt; = 1 $\rightarrow$ &lt;em&gt;ran10000&lt;/em&gt; = 0 (Confidence = 0.95, Lift =
1.14)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ran1500&lt;/em&gt; = 1 $\rightarrow$ &lt;em&gt;ran10000&lt;/em&gt; = 0 (Confidence = 0.85, Lift =
1.01)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splitting up the association by sprint and distance groups allowed us to
gain some more information on a runner&amp;rsquo;s likelihood to run an event
based off what they have run in the past. For example, running the 800m
race implies that you will not run a 10000m race, but running a 10000m
race does not necessarily imply sitting out in the 800m; Raines (a
400m/800m runner) and Hearn (a 10000m &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 800m runner) are examples of
this association. This data can also be replicated in a J48 decision
tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions-and-future-work&#34;&gt;Conclusions and Future Work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we are all pleased with many of the trends and predictions to come
out of this data, there are many more analyses to be had based on how
robust the dataset is. As mentioned earlier in the paper, it is Adam&amp;rsquo;s
hope that he can publish this data as a resource for coaches and
athletes alike to use OLS and multiple-linear regression techniques to
use their current times to predict estimated times in a separate event
and adding parameters (NCAA division, gender, class year, etc.) as
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to analyze the accuracy of our multi-linear regression
model compared to the similar Riegel Model. If proven more accurate, it
is our hope that this data will be used as the go-to resource for all
athletes to use to predict race times. Additionally, we could use
boosting to create a hybrid of the two estimations which could
potentially result in an even more accurate model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2019, Hearn plans to continue this research by merging
in budget statistics for track and field programs using the Equity in
Athletics Data Analysis database. With this data, he will be able to
determine the ideal funding for each program to minimize cost and
maximize athletic performance in track &amp;amp; field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dataset also continues to grow at the conclusion of each season.
With each new spring track season comes roughly 35,000 more observations
adding on to the data that has already been collected, resulting in an
even more accurate model. Also, the dataset currently only includes
outdoor track times. In the future, new mining methods may be
implemented to include indoor track indoor times as well. With this
data, an indoor/outdoor conversion coefficient for each event can be
created as a resource for coaches and athletes. Furthermore, since the
data are longitudinal in nature, we would like to modify the data to
track athletes individually to determine improvement across their
collegiate career, and examine if this differs by NCAA division and
gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the possibilities of analysis with this dataset are endless, it is
our hope that we can continue our research on this topic in the future.
Whether we present on this research at URCAS, or simply provide the
public with a website of prediction models, we hope that coaches and
athletes can use this data as a means to achieve their respective goals.&lt;/p&gt;
